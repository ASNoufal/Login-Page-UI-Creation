# Login page UI Creation

A new Flutter project.

## About this project


This is my first Flutter project, which I created to learn more about building user interfaces with Flutter. The project is a Login Screen  that displays a list of items and allows the user to interact with them by tapping on them. I used various Flutter widgets, such as Column and GestureDetector to create the UI.

In addition to learning about building UIs with Flutter, I also learned about managing state and handling user input. I used StatefulWidget to manage the state of the app and respond to changes in user input.

Overall, I'm excited about what I've learned so far and can't wait to continue building more advanced Flutter apps in the future.
